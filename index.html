                <p>
                    I have been trying to enter the software industry for a long time now. I started 
                    learning to code when I was 16, starting with python. I slowly moved to C# when my 
                    brother and I tried making our own video game. The next couple of years I tired over 
                    and over again to make a video game, always getting pretty far, but, sadly, I was never 
                    able to fully finsih one.

                <p>
                    When I went to college I went right into computer science, and I loved it, but after a year 
                    I realized I wanted to get into the industry faster, so I joined Thinkful, and I am so excited!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I would love to code anyone's website, I think it is so fun! I am so ready to get into a job 
                    helping people reach others through awesome websites!
